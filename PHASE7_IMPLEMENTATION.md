## 📊 Implementation Details

### Memory Store (Zustand)
```typescript
interface MemoryVerse {
  id: string;
  verseRef: string;
  verseText: string;
  translation: string;
  category?: string;
  tags: string[];
  createdAt: number;
  lastReviewed?: number;
  nextReview: number;
  reviewCount: number;
  easeFactor: number; // 1.3 to 2.5
  interval: number; // Days
  mastered: boolean;
}
```

### Spaced Repetition Algorithm
```typescript
// SM-2 Algorithm Implementation
- Quality 0-2: Forgot → Reset to 1 day, decrease ease
- Quality 3: Hard → Maintain interval, slight ease decrease
- Quality 4: Good → Increase interval by ease factor
- Quality 5: Easy → Large interval increase

Initial interval: 0 (due immediately)
First review: 1 day
Second review: 6 days
Subsequent: previous_interval * ease_factor

Mastered when: interval ≥ 30 days AND quality ≥ 4
```

### Devotional Data Structure
```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "title": "Devotional Title",
  "theme": "Faith|Love|Peace|etc.",
  "passage": {
    "ref": "Book Chapter:Verse",
    "text": "Full verse text"
  },
  "reflection": "Deep reflection on the passage",
  "prayer": "Guided prayer",
  "action": "Practical application step"
}
```
