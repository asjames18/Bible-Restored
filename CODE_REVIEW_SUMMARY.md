# Code Review Summary - Bible Project

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ All Critical Issues Fixed

---

## Executive Summary

I've completed a comprehensive review of the entire Bible Project codebase (frontend React/TypeScript app and backend Python scripts). The code is **well-structured and working as intended** with only minor fixes needed. All critical issues have been resolved.

---

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Windows Console Encoding Issue** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Severity:** Critical  
**Location:** Backend Python scripts  
**Issue:** Unicode characters (‚úì, ‚úó) in console output caused crashes on Windows due to cp1252 encoding limitations.

**Files Fixed:**
- `backend/fetch_kjv.py`
- `backend/restore_names.py`
- `backend/split_bible.py`

**Solution:** Added UTF-8 console encoding configuration at the start of each Python script:
```python
# Fix Windows console encoding issues
if sys.platform == 'win32':
    try:
        sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')
    except Exception:
        pass
```

### 2. **React Hook Dependency Warning** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Severity:** Warning  
**Location:** `frontend/src/components/VerseOfDay.tsx`  
**Issue:** `useEffect` hook missing `getRandomVerse` dependency, could cause stale closure issues.

**Solution:** Wrapped `getRandomVerse` function in `useCallback` to stabilize the dependency:
```typescript
const getRandomVerse = useCallback(() => {
  // ... implementation
}, [bible]);
```
