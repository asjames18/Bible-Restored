# Grammar Fixes Applied to Restored Hebrew Names Bible

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Jesus → Yahusha Replacement
**Issue:** Standalone "Jesus" was not being replaced (only "Jesus Christ" was handled)

**Fix Applied:**
- Added rule: `"Jesus"` → `"Yahusha"`
- **Result:** 723 instances of "Jesus" successfully replaced

**Examples:**
- Matthew 2:1: "Now when **Yahusha** was born in Bethlehem..."
- Matthew 1:16: "...of whom was born **Yahusha**, who is called Mashiach"

**Compound Forms:**
- "Jesus Christ" → "Yahusha Ha'Mashiach" (199 instances)
- "Christ Jesus" → "Yahusha Ha'Mashiach" (58 instances)

### 2. ✅ Article Grammar: "a Elohiym" → "an Elohiym"
**Issue:** Incorrect article usage before vowel-starting names

**Fix Applied:**
- Added grammar rule: `"a Elohiym"` → `"an Elohiym"`
- **Result:** 29 corrections made

**Examples:**
- Genesis 17:7: "to be **an Elohiym** unto thee"
- Deuteronomy 32:4: "**an Elohiym** of truth and without iniquity"
- 1 Samuel 2:3: "the Yahuah is **an Elohiym** of knowledge"

### 3. ✅ Possessive Form: "Yahuah'S" → "Yahuah's"
**Issue:** Capital 'S' in possessive form from original KJV "LORD'S"

**Fix Applied:**
- Added rule to handle possessive before base word: `"LORD'S"` → `"Yahuah's"`
- **Result:** 108 instances corrected

**Examples:**
- Exodus 12:11: "it is the **Yahuah's** passover"
- Exodus 13:9: "that the **Yahuah's** law may be in thy mouth"
- Exodus 12:27: "the sacrifice of the **Yahuah's** passover"
